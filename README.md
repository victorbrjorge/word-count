Install all of the app dependencies. This must be done once before running/building the app.

### `npm start`

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
